# 🛒 Shop Now, Buy Later – Cart Reminder Prototype

This is a simple React-based prototype that solves a real user problem:  
**Users often add items to their cart but forget to buy them later due to timing, budget, or special events.**

### 💡 The Idea

**“Shop Now, Buy Later”** allows users to:
- Add items to a cart
- Set a **custom reminder date**
- Optionally add a **personal message** (e.g., “Wife's birthday tomorrow – buy gifts!”)
- View **today’s reminders** to ensure timely purchasing

This helps improve user experience and potentially boosts conversion rates for e-commerce platforms.
